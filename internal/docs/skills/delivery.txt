**Version Control:**
- Create a new branch named `refactor/foobar` (or similar descriptive name)
- Add all modified and new files
- Commit with a clear, descriptive message
- Push the branch to GitHub using the provided remote URL command



**Additional Considerations:**
- Preserve all existing error handling and logging
- Maintain consistent code style with the existing codebase
- Add docstrings to new functions/methods
- Consider edge cases (e.g., corrupted files, permission issues)
- Ensure the refactoring doesn't break any existing functionality
