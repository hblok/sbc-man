**Testing**
- Use the unittest library.
- Only one TestCase class per module
- Never document test methods
- Do not add main() or call unittest.main() in test modules
- Run tests after each significant change
- Maintain > 80% code coverage for math and core modules
- Use setUp() and tearDown() for test fixtures

**Executing tests**
- To execute, run "python -m unittest" or similar.
- If need be, but ONLY if actually needed, install bazel and protoc.
- If need be, copy the temporary protobuf pb2.py files from internal/proto/compiled/* to sbcman/proto
- If protobuf pb2.py files or sbcman/proto/__init__.py were copied, DO NOT include them in the commit.
